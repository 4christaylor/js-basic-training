# Next Steps

At this point in time you have a firm foundation to really launch a mastery of basic JavaScript and are able to:

- Understand how JavaScript fits into modern web development
- Use built in JavaScript functions
- Use built in JavaScript functions to return values
- Discuss the different kinds of JavaScript Types
- Assign values, including values returned from functions, into variables
- Use string methods
- Create arrays and use array methods
- Create your own functions that define parameters and return values
- Think about difficult programming challenges in terms of easy to think about functions

Given that your ability to write easy to reason about functions is largely contingent on your fluency with built in JavaScript functions, and, that fluency comes from practice, it is highly recommended that you pursue as next steps the following twofold path:

1) Familiarize yourself with built in JavaScript methods, especially those for strings and arrays
2) Practice solving as many problems as possible, committing to the use of creating small fantasy functions

## Practice Solving Coding Challenges

There is a wealth of websites these days that provide coding challenges for solving. This author favors [CodeWars](https://codewars.com) for several reasons. First, the challenges have an excellent progression: you can start as an absolute beginner and continue for a long long time. Second, the solutions (which you get to see after you've solved the problem) are crowd sourced in a manner that tends to highlight well-written solutions. Many other sites, imo, have highlighted solutions that favor fewest characters, as opposed to legible intelligent code. Finally, CodeWars has testing front and center in their interface, and the practice of learning what a function should do based on the tests written for it is something you should learn earlier rather than later.

With that in mind. Go solve some CodeWars challenges. When you don't know what to do, write fantasy functions and research on MDN as necessary to learn new JavaScript techniques. After you've solved a challenge, take a look at the most upvoted solutions, and learn from them before moving to the next challenge.

I highly recommend going back to resolve challenges after a few days, without the aid of a solution to reference. This will consolidate your learning. At times, if you see something totally novel in someone else's solution, you might also resolve a challenge immediately after completing it, so long as you don't reference your previous work, or the solution you are hoping to emulate.
