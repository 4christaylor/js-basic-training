# Next Steps

At this point in time you have a firm foundation to really launch a mastery of basic JavaScript and are able to:

- Understand how JavaScript fits into modern web development
- Use built in JavaScript functions
- Use built in JavaScript functions to return values
- Discuss the different kinds of JavaScript Types
- Assign values, including values returned from functions, into variables
- Use string methods
- Create arrays and use array methods
- Create your own functions that define parameters and return values
- Think about difficult programming challenges in terms of easy to think about functions

Given that your ability to write easy to reason about functions is largely contingent on your fluency with built in JavaScript functions, and, that fluency comes from practice, it is highly recommended that you pursue as next steps the following twofold path:

1) Familiarize yourself with built in JavaScript methods, especially those for strings and arrays
2) Practice solving as many problems as possible, committing to the use of creating small fantasy functions

Please see the appendix as a resource for both documentation on built in methods, and, as a place to find more JavaScript coding challenges than you will ever need.
